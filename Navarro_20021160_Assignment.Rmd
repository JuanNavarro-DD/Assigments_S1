## 2.Manipulating Arrays

First lets set the seed to get random numbers with the following code, after having the seed setted, well create a vector with the function `runif` which by default creates a vector of random number from 0 to 1, this range can be changed adding two arguments when we call the function, `min` and `max`.
```{r,comment=NA}
studentno <- 20021160
set.seed(studentno)
my_vector <- runif(35)
my_vector
```

When the vector is created a summary of it is diplayed with an special format presented in the assigment guide. First the function `summary` is used to storage some statisticals details in the variable `suma` this details for vectors are: 

+ Minimum value
+ First quantile
+ Median
+ Mean
+ Third quantile
+ Maximum value

the `cat` function is used to create the format and with the variable `suma`, the requiered values were presented.
```{r,comment=NA}
suma <- summary(my_vector)
cat("Minimum value:",suma[["Min."]],"\tMaximum value:", suma[["Max."]],"\nAverage value:", suma[["Mean"]],"\tMedian value:",suma[["Median"]])
```
A random number between 8 and 12 is selected with the function `sample`, this number is assigned to varible `n` and the nth smallest value and nth largest value. This is done by sorting the vector with the function `sort` twice and returning the nth value. However, the second time we add the `decreasing` argument to the function to have the vector sorted from the largest value to the smallest.
```{r,comment=NA}
n <- sample(8:12,1)
nth <- paste(n,"th",sep="")
cat("The",nth,"smallest value is:", sort(my_vector)[n],"\nThe",nth,"largest value is:",sort(my_vector,decreasing = TRUE)[n])
```
The vector now is reshaped to a 5 by 7 matrix with the function `matrix`. To know which column has the largest sum the function `order` with the function `apply` were used. the function `apply` first creates a vector with the sum of all the columns in order of the column, for instance, the first column sum is the first element of the output vector of the function `apply`. Then the function order returns the indexes of, in this case, the vector of the sums of each column ordered, which represent teh column itself. similar to the `sort` function but with indexes. The same functions were applied for the sum of each row.
```{r, comment=NA}
mat <- matrix(my_vector,nrow = 5,ncol = 7)
lgst_sum <- order(apply(mat,2,sum),decreasing = T)[1]
smst_sum <- order(apply(mat,1,sum))[1]
cat("Column",lgst_sum,"has the largest sum of all columns","\nRow",smst_sum,"has the smallest sum of all rows")
```
The values of mat[i,j] that are grater than 0.4 are replaced for mat[i,j]-1. This is done in the first line. The last step is sum all the elements in the matrix with the function `sum` and present the results in the requiered format.
```{r,comment=NA}
mat[mat>=0.4]=mat[mat>=0.4]-1
sum_mat <- sum(mat)
cat("The sum of the new matrix is",sum_mat)
```

## 3. Plotting

```{r,comment=NA,message=F}
library(R.matlab)
A <- readMat('Data/paviauni.mat')
```
Using the function `dim` the dimmension of the array will be display
```{r,comment=NA}
cat("A$X is",dim(A$X)[1],"by",dim(A$X)[2],"by",dim(A$X)[3])
cat("A$groundtruth is", dim(A$groundtruth)[1],"by",dim(A$groundtruth)[2])
```

```{r,comment=NA}
for(i in 0:9){
  cat("Class",paste0(i,":"),table(A$groundtruth)[i+1],"pixels\n")
}
```
